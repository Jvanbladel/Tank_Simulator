Project Purpose and details:
This was a group project that focused on the process of application development. 
The project was made in 5 weeks with rigourous planning and a dedicated team of players.

What the program does:
The program simulates a tanks projectile using physics to shoot an emeny tank. This is done
by caluating the angle, weight, wind and power of the projectile. The game also uses calculus 
to determine the tangent line of the projectile showing the current direction the projectile 
is moving.

Future areas of improvement:
There are some small bugs with collision, the ground could be destroyed on impact, and a better
AI could be implemented using genetic learning algorithms.

Thanks for looking at my project!
